The Customer and Sales dataset in Power BI integrates customer details (like AgeGroup, City, Customer ID, FirstName, LastName, PostalCode, Region, Segment and State) with sales transactions (such as transaction date, product details, quantity, and total amount). This dataset enables analysis of sales performance and customer behavior. It helps visualize metrics like sales trends, customer spending patterns, and regional sales distribution. By combining these elements, Power BI provides actionable insights into business performance and customer interactions.
